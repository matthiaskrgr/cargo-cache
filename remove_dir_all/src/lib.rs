//! Reliably remove a directory and all of its children.
//!
//! This library provides an alternative implementation of
//! [`std::fs::remove_dir_all`] from the Rust std library. It varies in the
//! following ways:
//! - the `parallel` feature parallelises the deletion. This is useful when high
//!   syscall latency is occurring, such as on Windows (deletion IO accrues to
//!   the process), or network file systems of any kind. This is off by default.
//! - It tolerates files not being deleted atomically (this is a Windows
//!   specific behaviour).
//! - It resets the readonly flag on Windows as needed.
//!
//! Like `remove_dir_all` it assumes both that the caller has permission to
//! delete the files, and that they don't have permission to change permissions
//! to be able to delete the files: no ACL or chmod changes are made during
//! deletion. This is because hardlinks can cause such changes to show up and
//! affect the filesystem outside of the directory tree being deleted.
//!   
//! The extension trait [`RemoveDir`] can be used to invoke `remove_dir_all` on
//! an open [`File`](std::fs::File), where it will error if the file is not a directory,
//! and otherwise delete the contents. This allows callers to be more confident that
//! what is deleted is what was requested even in the presence of malicious
//! actors changing the filesystem concurrently.
//!
//! The functions [`remove_dir_all`], [`remove_dir_contents`], and [`ensure_empty_dir`]
//! are intrinsically sensitive to file system races, as the path to the
//! directory to delete can be substituted by an attacker inserting a symlink
//! along that path. Relative paths with one path component are the least
//! fragile, but using [`RemoveDir::remove_dir_contents`] is recommended.
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! - parallel: When enabled, deletion of directories is parallised. (#parallel)[more details]
//! - log: Include some log messages about the deletion taking place.
//!
//! About the implementation. The implementation prioritises security, then
//! robustness (e.g. low resource situations), and then finally performance.
//!
//! ## Security
//!
//! On all platforms directory related race conditions are avoided by opening
//! paths and then iterating directory contents and deleting names in the
//! directory with _at style syscalls. This does not entirely address possible
//! races on unix style operating systems (but see the funlinkat call on
//! FreeBSD, which could if more widely adopted). It does prevent attackers from
//! replacing intermediary directories with symlinks in order to fool privileged
//! code into traversing outside the intended directory tree. This is the same
//! as the standard library implementation.
//!
//! This function is not designed to succeed in the presence of concurrent
//! actors in the tree being deleted - for instance, adding files to a directory
//! being deleted can prevent the directory being deleted for an arbitrary
//! period by extending the directory iterator indefinitely.
//!
//! Directory traversal only ever happens downwards. In future, to accommodate
//! very large directory trees (greater than file descriptor limits deep) the
//! same path may be traversed multiple times, and the quadratic nature of that
//! will be mitigated by a cache of open directories. See [#future-plans](Future
//! Plans)
//!
//! ## Robustness
//!
//! Every opened file has its type checked through the file handle, and then
//! unlinked or scanned as appropriate. Syscall overheads are minimised by
//! trust-but-verify of the node type metadata returned from directory scanning:
//! only names that appear to be directories get their contents scanned. The
//! consequence is that if an attacker replaces a non-directory with a
//! directory, or vice versa, an error will occur - but the `remove_dir_all` will
//! not escape from the directory tree. On Windows file deletion requires
//! obtaining a handle to the file, but again the kind metadata from the
//! directory scan is used to avoid re-querying the metadata. Symlinks are
//! detected by a failure to open a path with `O_NOFOLLOW`, they are unlinked with
//! no further processing.
//!
//! ## Serial deletion
//!
//! Serial deletion occurs recursively - open, read, delete
//! contents-except-for-directories, repeat.
//!
//! Parallel deletion builds on serial deletion by utilising a thread pool for
//! IO which can block:
//! - directory scanning
//! - calls to unlink and fstat
//! - file handle closing (yes, that can block)
//!
//! Parallel is usually a win, but some users may value compile time or size of
//! compiled code more, so the `parallel` feature is opt-in.
//!
//! We suggest permitting the end user to control this choice: when adding
//! remove-dir-all as a dependency to a library crate, expose a feature
//! "parallel" that sets `remove-dir-all/parallel`. This will permit the user of
//! your library to control the parallel feature inside `remove_dir_all`
//!
//! e.g.
//!
//! ```Cargo.toml
//! [features]
//! default = []
//! parallel = ["remove_dir_all/parallel"]
//! ...
//! [dependencies]
//! remove_dir_all = {version = "0.8"}
//!
//! ## Future Plans
//!  Open directory handles are kept in
//! a lg-spaced cache after the first 10 levels:
//! level10/skipped1/level12/skipped2/skipped3/skipped4/level16. If EMFILE is
//! encountered, no more handles are cached, and directories are opened by
//! re-traversing from the closest previously opened handle. Deletion should
//! succeed even only 4 file descriptors are available: one to hold the root,
//! two to iterate individual directories, and one to open-and-delete individual
//! files, though that will be quadratic in the depth of the tree, successfully
//! deleting leaves only on each iteration.
//!
//! IO Prioritisation:
//! 1) directory scanning when few paths are queued for deletion (to avoid
//!    ending up accidentally serial) - allowing keeping the other queues full.
//! 4) close/CloseHandle (free up file descriptors)
//! 2) rmdir (free up file descriptors)
//! 3) unlink/SetFileInformationByHandle (to free up directories so they can be
//!    rmdir'd)
//!
//! Scanning/unlinking/rmdiring is further biased by depth and lexicographic
//! order: this minimises the number of directories being worked on in parallel,
//! so very branchy trees are less likely to exhaust kernel resources or
//! application memory or thrash the open directory cache.
