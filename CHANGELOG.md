Fix --keep-duplicate-crates which was counting wrong and only removing package == <N> and not every package bigger than <N> (#122)

Fix --remove-if.. --remove-dir=x which was treated like just --remove-dir, skipped validating the remove-if date and removed everything (#127)

## Version 0.8.3 (f26f8b8)
```
MSRV: bump from 1.56 to 1.57

Fix panic when "cargo cache toolchain" runs on a system that does not have rust installed via rustup
but instead via system distributor for example.
Instead of crashing, display a nice info message: "Could not find any toolchains installed via rustup!" (#121)
```

## Version 0.8.2 (b7bf4f4)
```
Fix build with nightly rustc 1.60.0-nightly (734368a20 2022-02-07)
unreachable!("{}") is no longer accepted: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/92137

Build: add "vendored-libgit" feature that enables libgit2 vendoring (statically link libgit2 into cargo-cache instead of linking agaist the system libgit2)
The feature is on by default but it can be skipped (using --no-default-features) by distributors who would like cargo-cache to link against system libgit2
```

## Version 0.8.1 (1fcffbb)
```
Fix: 'verify' incorrectly determines paths as missing due to different unicode representations. (#113 / #114)

New deps:
	unicode-normalization 0.1.19
```

## Version 0.8.0 (e36f9df)
```
Add new subcommand "verify"
cargo cache verify  tries to check corrupted (modified) crate sources
The command looks into the .crate archive and compares the contained files with the extracted sources.
If we find files that are not the same size in both places, the source is considered corrupted.
cargo cache verify --clean-corrupted will automatically remove the corrupted sources. (supports --dry-run as well)

Upgrade from clap 2.33.3 to 3.0.0
If you notice any change in behaviour that is not listed here, please let me know!

Cli: removed "cargo cache query -h" for --human-readable because it was ambiguous with -h of --help.

Cli: fix bugs where I was implementing a subcommand cargo-cache foo but then actually checking for it as an argument cargo ceche --foo
or vice versa.
Found during migration to clap v3

New deps:
	flate2 1.0.22
	tar 0.4.38
```

Add "trim" subcommand which gets a --limit param and trims the cache down to that size limit.
	While calculating the cache size, registry indices and installed binaries are skipped.

Added new clean-unref subcommand which removes all crates that are not referenced in the 
    dependency-tree of a crate from the cache.
    By default it will check if it can find a Cargo.toml nearby, alternatively,
    you can pass the --manifest-path <path/to/Cargo.toml> to specify a Cargo.toml.
    This command helps minimizing the ci-cache of travis/azure-ci/github-actions etc. (#76)

local: ignore crate deps when using the local subcommand
	this fixes "cargo-cache local" "freezing" when being run while a different process was already writing to the $CARGO_HOME
Print message that we are clearing the cache when using autoclean after printing the before-stats since clearing can
	take some time depending on hardware
Add "offline_tests" feature which disables tests that would require internet connection
	(to download crates/registry indices and initialize ${CARGO_HOMES})
Add --remove-if-younger-than and --remove-if-older-than to remove files in the cache by date.
	This requires the --remove-dir argument to know where files should be removed from.
	You can pass a time or a date as formatted parameter to the flags for example YYYY.MM.DD or HH::MM::SS.

## Version 0.3.4 (650849a)
````
Fix bug where `cargo cache local` would panic on crates with workspaces
		This was caused by passing wrong parameters to cargo_metadata when parsing the manifest
Add ci-autoclean feature
		The feature creates a `cargo-cache` binary that only executes `cargo cache --autoclean` by default (requires no arguments, just run `cargo-cache`).
		and has all other features and dependencies stripped out.
		This is intended for usage on continuous integration when the $CARGO_HOME is cached in order to reduce size	before uploading the cargo home to the ci cache.
		Run `cargo install (--git github.com/matthiaskrgr/cargo-cache / cargo-cache) --no-default-features --features ci-autoclean` to install inside ci.

Fix version numbers registry source cache findings of query subcmd being cut off (#41)
Fix crash when calling "cargo cache local" on a target dir that was actively used by a cargo process.
	I was collecting files, filtering out nonexisting paths and then (in parallel) requesting metadata on 
	the files but sometimes it happened that temporary files were deleted by cargo between the collection of
	available paths and a rayon job asking for the metadata leading fs::metadata() to fail unwrapping as the
	file was already gone.
	Mitigate by only asking for metadata if the file still exists right before doing so. (#43).
Fix wrong order of lines in "query" subcmd when --sort-by size is passed (#42)

Parallelize internal cache accesses resulting in reduced wall clock execution time
Fix some paths being linuxish on windows
Print size of the registry index (${CARGO_HOME}/registry/index) in default view
Add "query" subcommand (run "cargo cache query" or short "cargo cache q"
	Pass a parameter which will be interpreted as regex to only display sizes of
	items that match.
	For example "cargo cache query serde_derive" will print the sizes of all findings and
	their sizes of this crate inside the subdirectories of the cache.
	You can get human readable sizes via --human-readable and sort by size/name (alphabetically)
	via --sort-by $option
	Check out cargo cache q --help for more details
Add libs.rs badge to readme
Revert "rename -l (--list-dirs) to -L."
	short form of --list-dirs is -l again.
Add "local" subcommand ("cargo cache local" or "cargo cache l") which displays
	sizes of a target/ dir of a built crate
Make --remove-dir accept "registry-index" for clearing out the registry index
Make --dry-run print a summary of how much space would be freed
Use "home" crate instead of "cargo" to get the ${CARGO_HOME} value.
